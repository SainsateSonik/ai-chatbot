## Summary

1. **Assistant "Explain this"** - Added the ability to select specific portions of the assistant's response and get detailed explanations through a context menu. Users can right-click on any part of the selected text of the assistant's message to access this feature, making it quicker to go in depth to understand a term better, or an entire paragraph if needed. Added validation to ensure the "Explain this" context menu option only appears when text is selected within a single message, preventing errors from multi-message selections.

2. **Quick Action; "Add to prompt"** - With the selected text from an assistant's message, you can now right click and select option to add the text to the prompt textarea. The textarea will now be in focus for user to continue adding more details to the conversation prompt.

3. **Assistant Response Tone Control** - Introduced the ability to control the tone of the assistant's responses. Users can now select from different tone options (such as friendly, professional, creative and technical) to customize how the assistant communicates, with the tone preference being applied through enhanced system prompts.
